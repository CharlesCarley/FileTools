* [Make FT](#make-ft)
  * [Output](#output)

```txt
Uasge: makeft.exe tablename ofilename ifile[0] ... ifile[n]
```

| Argument    | Description                                       |
|:-----------:|:-------------------------------------------------:|
| tablename   | A unique name for the output table array.         |
| ofilename   | Output file and path name for the generated code. |
| ifile[0..n] | Input API declaration file(s) to parse.           |

## Output

The makeft output should be added to the library that contains the rest of the 
custom file format implementation.

```

The pure virtual methods in [ftFile](https://github.com/snailrose/FileTools/blob/master/File/ftFile.h) provide access to the makeft compiler output.

```c
virtual void*       getTables(void) = 0;
virtual FBTsize     getTableSize(void) = 0;
```

The [MakeFT](https://github.com/snailrose/FileTools/blob/master/CMake/Readme.md) utility can be used to attach table generation to a build.

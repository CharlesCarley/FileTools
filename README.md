# FileTools
File tools is a file format based off the blender .blend file.  Which basically consists of a set of tables that is compiled from a c/c++ API.  The compiled lookup tables contain the type names, the size of all the types, and the structures that contain the types. 



See the wiki for an introduction to the file format.
